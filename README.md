# Wall-EEE (Mars Rover)

This project was developed for Year 2 of Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London.

A team of 6 worked on the project, each with a specific role:
- **Command**
- Control
- Vision
- Energy
- Drive
- Integration

The overall aim was to produce all the code necessary for a mars rover, tasked with identifying different coloured ping-pong balls. I was personally responsible for the 'Command' part of the project, which involved building a web server and website used to interact with the rover, and establish a communication link with the rover over TCP.

An overview of the Command architecture:
